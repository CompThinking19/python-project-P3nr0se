Hello! If you're reading this, it means you've been looking at the files for my python project.
You might be wondering what all of this is for, and the basic explanation is that it's the beginning (or attempted beginning) of a game.
I'm an amateur at coding, but the purpose of this game is to build rockets, fly to other planets in the solar system and build bases on those planets.
I intend to add every major planet in the solar system, as well as moons, planetoids and other celestial bodies that exist.
Ultimately I would like there to be various conditions that have to be met in order to fly to different planets.
Some are too cold to get to without special equipment.
Others are too close to the sun.
And then, there is also the asteroid belt to consider, which would be too dangerous to cross without armoured materials for your rockets.
So basically, I wanted to make a game that connects us to our home, the solar system that gave us life. I want us to appreciate its uniqueness.

So thank you for looking at all of this!
