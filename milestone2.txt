Your code runs and outputs your introductory text before ending, which is great. I think it's a great idea to put that into a separate file and not clutter up your primary file with it. You also have a lot of really complex code and, in the absence of some sense of a master plan—or more descriptive comments—it's hard for me to direct you in one direction or the other. As it stands, the level of complexity you've achieved is admirable. The tick between now and the final submission, however, is going to be reining in that complexity. I'd say you should expect a fair amount of your code to be commented out for the final submission. Maybe just focus on getting to the moon?
