"Greetings, Commander! The Executives in the U.N wanted us to congratulate you on your promotion.
As of now, you are officially in charge of the First Terran Stellar Expedition!
We hope you don't mind the extra company on the I.S.S, because as of this moment,
resources will be transitioned from the ground into orbit.
It is your job to put them to good use. As you know, the folks in the U.N can be rather stingy when it comes to group projects,
This is why until we can independently collect resources from the other Celestial Bodies in system,
it is absolutely imperative that resources are only used when necessary. You guys off world are going to have to lay off the
parties and orbital drag racing for a bit."

"Our first objective here at the F.T.S.E will be the serious occupation of Earth's natural satellite Luna.
It is confirmed by earlier probes that there are valuable fuel resources on the moon.
Your job will be the construction of the first sustainable human colony on a celestial body separate from Mother Earth.
The resources available to you will be displayed shortly, as soon as the Orbital Logistics department sends the information.
If our first landing on the moon decades ago was a small step for man, this will be the first true giant leap for mankind."

Commander, we have specific resources available to us... you may type the key phrases
 "'getfuel', 'getmats', 'getarmour', 'gethotmats', 'getrockets' and 'getcoldmats' Get" to see your Resources!
 Unfortunately, because the computer systems on the I.S.S haven't actually been updated since the
 second millennia or something, all command keys will be case sensitive.

 From there, consider the building requirements by typing in 'getrequirements'.
