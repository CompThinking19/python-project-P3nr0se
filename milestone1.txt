You've got a lot of material here that's going to serve you well as we look toward the next milestone. I do think I'd like to see a bit more documentation here as far as the role each of these pieces of code is serving in the whole. You have comments that give the 'what' of these pieces, but I don't yet understand the 'why' of much of it, so I'd like to have a conversation where you step me through the pieces, so we can talk about how they fit together. For example, you have several 'if' statements inside your init function on your Logistics class. It's not clear to me if that's where those checks should take place, but I don't understand exactly how they're going to be used in the game. It seems to me that Logistics should have a set of default values that are initialized when it's created and the checks would come later.
